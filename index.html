                    <h3>Full Stack Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        Full Stack Developers provide both front-end and back-end services. Front-end development addresses the user's experience, what they see and how they experience the app or site.  Back-end development deals with the foundation that makes the user experience function and includes database management, debugging, testing, and other deeper programming skills. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Customer Satisfaction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Customer Satisfaction is achieved through active communications and skilled project management services. Developers who stay up-to-date on current standards and accessibility requirements, along with trends and security issues will improve the user experience and accessability.  Thus, increasing site visits, length of stay and ultimately growing your business.
                    </p>
                    <h3>More Than Building A Site!</h3>
                    <p>
                    To build a great site, a developer has to have a knowledge of marketing an understanding of his/her customer needs.  He/she needs to have the skills to update a site, accomplish routine audits, debug issues and to ensure that your site, or application, responds to your audience and the needs of your business.  Without these skills your site is just a site that is never seen, an app no one uses.
